## About this code  
The core of this code is **Dual Gamma Cameras**. After finished a simulation, Two output files are generated. the one is a 2D image related gamma camera(#1), another is related gamma camera(#2).   

### Geometry  
1) World  
2) Gamma Cameras (just for checking a shape of beam)  

### Source   
1) 144 keV gamma souce (filename: iso_run.mac)   

### Scoring    
1) Gamma Cameras (At the end of simulation, Two kinds of output files is generated.  
the one is generated from gamma camera(#1), another is generated from gamma camera(#2))
